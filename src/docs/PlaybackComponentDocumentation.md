# Playback Component Documentation

## Overview
The Playback Component is responsible for rendering video playback functionality with support for 1080p HD resolution and a minimum frame rate of 30 FPS. It utilizes lazy loading to enhance user experience and ensures videos start playing within 2 seconds of user requests.

## Features
- **HD Playback**: Supports videos in 1080p resolution.
- **Lazy Loading**: Fetches video after a delay of 2 seconds to optimize loading times.
- **Playback Controls**: Allows users to play, pause, rewind, and fast forward the video.

## Usage
```tsx
import PlaybackComponent from './components/PlaybackComponent';

function App() {
  return <PlaybackComponent videoSrc="http://example.com/video.mp4" />;
}
```

## Performance Testing
Ensure that the component maintains performance under various network conditions and validates lazy loading functionality.

# Microservices Architecture Design
## Overview
Design the application architecture using microservices to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Service Interactions
- **Play Recorder Service**
  - Responsible for capturing gameplay sessions.
  - Interacts with the Database Service for storing session data.
  
- **Gameplay Analyzer Service**
  - Provides insights and statistics on recorded gameplay.
  - Interacts with the Database Service for storing analysis data.

- **Video Annotation Service**
  - Allows users to mark and comment on gameplay moments.
  - Interacts with the Database Service for storing annotations.

- **Recommendation Service**
  - Provides gear, configuration, and practice recommendations.
  - Interacts with Llama and OpenAI APIs for analyzing data and generating insights.

## Data Flow
1. User records gameplay with the Play Recorder Service.
2. Recorded gameplay data is sent to the Database Service.
3. The Gameplay Analyzer Service processes the data, generates insights, and sends this information back to the Database Service.
4. Users can interact with the Video Annotation Service to comment on moments, which gets stored in the Database.
5. Recommendations are generated via the Recommendation Service using insights from Gameplay Analyzer and external APIs.

## Benefits
- Independent scalability: Each service can scale based on its demand.
- Maintainability: Services can be updated independently without affecting others.
- Enhanced collaboration: Teams can work on different services simultaneously.
